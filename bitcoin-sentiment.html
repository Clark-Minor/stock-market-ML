<h2>BitCoin (BTC) Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter</h2>
<p>I chose to research bitcoin because I have heard it is a highly volatile equity. The graph on top represents BitCoin’s value over the course of an hour. The bottom graph represents positive and negative tweets about BitCoin over the course of an hour. The model used was sentiment analysis with natural language processing in Python. I have outlined an area of interest in a gray box between both graphs. We can see the value of BitCoin steadily rise in the green circled section in direct correlation with the large positive difference between positive and negative tweets. We then see the value of BTC start to waver in the red circled section just as the purple “negative sentiment” line crosses the light blue “positive sentiment” line. Finally, BitCoin’s value rises once again when there is a large positive differential between positive and negative tweets. From this sample we can conclude that the value of BitCoin on cryptocurrency markets is directly correlated to the area under the positive sentiment curve and above the negative sentiment curve.<br>

Obviously, this is a very small window of time. We would eventually like our model to predict markets over weeks, months, and years. A lot of data remains to be collected to verify our model for longer periods of time.
