<h2>BitCoin Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter</h2>

<h3>Twitter Sentiment vs. Bitcoin Value over 1 Hour</h3>
<img src='plots/BitCoin Twitter Sentiment.png' width="500">


<p>The graph on top represents BitCoin’s value over the course of an hour. The bottom graph positive and negative tweets about BitCoin over the course of an hour. The model used was sentiment analysis with natural language processing in Python. I have outlined an area of interest in a gray box between both graphs. We can see the value of BitCoin steadily rise in the green circled section in direct correlation with the large positive difference between positive and negative tweets. We then see the value of BTC start to waver in the red circled section just as the purple “negative sentiment” line crosses the light blue “positive sentiment” line. Finally, the BitCoin’s value rises once again when there is a large positive differential between positive and negative tweets. From this sample we can conclude that the more positive tweets about BitCoin on Twitter, the higher its value on cryptocurrency markets.</p>
