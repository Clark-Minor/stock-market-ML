<h2>Mylan (MYL) Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter</h2>
<h3>Stocksight Usage</h3>
<p>For this experiment I thought it would be interesting to play a pharmaceutical angle given the global pandemic currently occuring. Mylan is a company that produces 200mg Hydroxychloroquine tablets. New York is currenly looking into the drug as a treatment for coronavirus, or Covid-19. This run of stocksight searches for the ticker 'MYL' and the keywords 'myl','mylan','manufacturing','hydroxychloroquine','hydroxychloraquine','sulfate','nasdaq','medication' on financial Twitter feeds such as @nytimesbusiness.</p>
